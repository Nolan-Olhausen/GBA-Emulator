# GBA-Emulator (WIP)

A Game Boy Advance emulator written in C, designed to replicate the GBA's hardware and provide an accurate emulation experience. This emulator implements the ARM7TDMI CPU (supporting ARM and Thumb instruction sets), memory management, and PPU graphics modes (0‚Äì4).  

While still under development, the emulator successfully passes several key test ROMs, showcasing its growing capabilities.

## Test Results Overview 
Below is the current status of test ROMs.  

| Test ROM            | Status   | Notes                          |  
|---------------------|----------|--------------------------------|  
| **arm.gba**         | ‚úÖ Pass  | ARM instruction set test.      |  
| **armwrestler.gba** | ‚úÖ Pass  | Stress test for ARM accuracy.  |  
| **hello.gba**       | ‚úÖ Pass  | Basic program functionality.   |  
| **memory.gba**      | ‚úÖ Pass  | Validates memory operations.   |  
| **panda.gba**       | ‚úÖ Pass  | Panda sprite rendering test.   |  
| **shades.gba**      | ‚úÖ Pass  | Tests gradient rendering.      |  
| **stripes.gba**     | ‚úÖ Pass  | Striped pattern rendering.     |  
| **thumb.gba**       | ‚úÖ Pass  | Thumb instruction set test.    |  
| **bios.gba**        | ‚ùå Fail  | Bios setup test. It is successfully setting up the bios, but due to a video mode issue, the GBA startup animation freezes on the Nintendo text preventing ROM startup.    |  
| **brin_demo.gba**       | ‚ùå Fail  | Tiling rendering. Successfully renders tiles, but due to video mode issue, it is frozen on initial position preventing user from moving position with inputs.    |  
| **sbb_reg.gba**       | ‚ùå Fail  | Tiling rendering. Successfully renders tiles, but due to video mode issue, it is frozen on initial position preventing user from moving position with inputs.    |  
| **nes.gba**        | ‚ùå Fail  | NES test. Have not looked into or attempted this yet.    | 
| **suite.gba**        | ‚ùå Fail  | General GBA test suite. Due to same video mode issue causing freeze, it is frozen on main menu and can not navigate through test menus.    |
